# Cloud-Native Development with the Toolkit

In the previous section you got hands on experience of using the Cloud-Native Toolkit to take a starter kit through the pipeline, to build and test it, package it and deploy it.  This section will go a little deeper and explain some of the key activities being performed.

The next few pages allow you to explore some of the key concepts:

- [**DevOps**](devops.md) : the concepts of DevOps and GitOps are key to understanding the Cloud-Native Toolkit
- [**Testing**](testing.md) : having a good test strategy to find issues as soon as possible
- [**Static Analysis**](analysis.md) : using static analysis tools can also help identify vulnerabilities and bugs
- [**Pipeline**](pipeline.md) : The pipeline tool is what drives the automation of building and delivering applications
- [**Image Signing**](image-sign.md) : Image signing with Container Image Security Enforcement enables you to enforce trusted workloads within your Kubernetes deployments.
