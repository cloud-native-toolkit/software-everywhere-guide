# Continuous Delivery - fast start

<!--- cSpell:ignore grpc jsonnet ksonnet -->

[Argo CD](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/){: target=_blank } is a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes. The deployment environment is a namespace in a container platform like Kubernetes or Red Hat OpenShift.

Argo CD models a collection of applications as a project and uses a Git repository to store the application's desired state.

Argo CD is flexible in the structure of the application configuration represented in the Git repository.

Argo CD supports defining Kubernetes manifests in a number of ways:

- helm charts
- kustomize
- ksonnet
- jsonnet
- plain directory of yaml/json manifests
- custom plugins

Argo CD compares the actual state of the application in the cluster with the desired state defined in Git and determines if
they are out of sync. When it detects the environment is out of sync, Argo CD can be configured to either send out a
notification to kick off a separate reconciliation process or Argo CD can automatically synchronize the environments to
ensure they match.

!!!Note
    Confidential information like passwords and security tokens should not be checked into the Git repository. [Managing secrets in Argo CD](#managing-secrets-in-argo-cd) provides information on how to handle confidential information in the GitOps repo.

## Configuring GitOps with Argo CD

**Terminology:**

Argo CD uses a number of terms to refer to the components

- Application - A deployable unit

    In the context of the environment, an application is one Helm chart that contains one container image that was produced by one CI pipeline. While Helm charts and images could certainly be combined to make more sophisticated applications in more advanced scenarios, we will be using this simple definition here.

- Project - A collection of applications that make up a solution

### Set up the GitOps repo

!!!Todo
    Is this better in the developer setup section?

Argo CD uses a Git repo to express the desired state of the Kubernetes environment. The basic setup uses one repository to represent one [*project*](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user-guide/projects/). Within that repository, each [*application*](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/declarative-setup/#applications) that makes up the project will be described in its own folder. The repository will also contain a branch for each destination (i.e. cluster and namespace) into which we want to deploy the applications.

!!!Note
    There is nothing special about a git repository used for git-ops. All that is required at a minimum is a hosted git repository that is accessible from by the Argo CD instance.  The [Argo CD Starter Kit](https://github.com/IBM/template-argocd-gitops) used in the following steps is optional and provides some application templates to help simplify some configuration activities.

1. Create a new repo from the [Argo CD Starter Kit](https://github.com/IBM/template-argocd-gitops) `https://github.com/IBM/template-argocd-gitops/generate`.

    click **Use this template** - If you see a 404 error when you click on the link, you need to sign in to github.

1. Clone the project to your machine

    ```shell
    git clone ${GIT_URL_GITOPS}
    ```

1. navigate into the directory

    ```shell
    cd ${GIT_DIRECTORY}
    ```

1. Create and push test branch

    ```shell
    git checkout -b test
    git push -u origin test
    ```

### Hook the CI pipeline to the CD pipeline

The last stage in the CI pipeline updates a GitOps repository with the updated application metadata from the build. In
order to do that, the CI pipeline needs to know which repository should be used and needs the credentials to push changes
to that repository. As with other configuration within the pipeline, this is handled with config maps and secrets:

- A secret named `git-credentials` holds the credentials the CI pipeline uses to access all the repositories in the Git host (e.g. GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket, etc.  If you used the [Toolkit CLI](../reference/cli.md) to register the pipeline then this secret has already been created.
- A config map named `gitops-repo` holds the url and branch for the gitops repository.

Fortunately the [Toolkit CLI](../reference/cli.md) provides a `gitops` command to simplify this step. Information on how to use the command as well as the alternative manual steps can be found in the [Toolkit CLI gitops command](../reference/cli.md#gitops) section.

1. Make sure to switch context to the project/namespace CI namespace

    ```shell
    oc project ${DEV_NAMESPACE}
    ```

1. Run the `gitops` command to create the config map and secret in the CI namespace

    ```shell
    igc gitops
    ```

!!!Note
    - For the secret to be available to the CI pipeline, the secret needs to be created in the same namespace where the
    pipeline is running.
    - The value provided for `branch` is the one the pipeline will use to when committing changes to trigger the CD
    pipeline.

As of v2.0.0 of the Tekton tasks and the Jenkins pipelines, the CI pipeline will create a folder and the initial configuration for an application deployment if it doesn't already exist. This means, there is no other manual configuration required to set up the repository.

Now run a new Pipeline and make sure a directory for the application is created on the gitops git repository.  This is required before configuring ArgoCD.

### Configure Release namespaces

ArgoCD will deploy the application into the "releases" namespace such as ${TEST_NAMESPACE} or ${STAGING_NAMESPACE}

1. Create a release namespace where ArgoCD will deploy the application

    ```shell
    oc new-project ${TEST_NAMESPACE}
    ```

The release namespaces need pull secrets for the application container images to be pull.

=== "OpenShift Image Registry"

    If you are using the OpenShift Image Registry then you need to give permission to the services accounts in the "release" namespaces to be able to pull images from the "development" namespaces.

    - Grant access to service accounts in the new `test` or `staging` namespace to pull the container image from the `dev` namespace

    ```shell
    oc policy add-role-to-group system:image-puller system:serviceaccounts:{TEST_NAMESPACE} -n {DEV_NAMESPACE}
    ```

=== "IBM Container Registry"

    If you are using the IBM Container Registry then you need to copy the pull secret `all-icr-io` from the `default` namespace and then add this secret to the service account used by your application (ie `default` service account)

    - Use the Toolkit CLI to copy the secret and setup the service account

    ```shell
    igc pull-secret ${TEST_NAMESPACE} -t default -z default
    ```
=== "Other Container Registries"

    If you are using an external image registry from a 3rd party provider like quay.io or dockerhub.io then you need to create the pull secret of type "docker-registry" and add it to the service account. Check the OpenShift Documentation [Using pull secrets](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.6/openshift_images/managing_images/using-image-pull-secrets.html)

### Register the GitOps repo in ArgoCD

Now that the repository has been created, we need to tell ArgoCD where it is.

- Log into ArgoCD

- Click on the gear icon on the left menu to access the Settings options

    ![ArgoCD config](./images/argocd-config.png)

- Select the `Repositories` option

- Click either the `Connect Repo using HTTPS` or `Connect Repo using SSH` button at the top and provide the information
for the GitOps repo you just created. For `HTTPS` you can use the access token you used when you ran `igc gitops`

### Create a project in Argo CD

In Argo CD terms, each deployable component is an application and applications are grouped into projects. Projects are not required for Argo CD to be able to deploy applications, but it helps to organize applications and provide some restrictions on what can be done for applications that make up a project.

=== "Argo CD UI"

    1. Log into the Argo CD user interface

    1. Click on the gear icon on the left menu to access the Settings options

        ![Argo CD config](./images/argocd-config.png)

    1. Select the Projects option

    1. Press the New Project button at the top of the page

    1. Specify the properties for the new project

        - Name - Provide the name for the project
        - Description - A brief description of the project
        - Source - Press Add source and pick the Git repository from the list that was added previously
        - Destinations
            - Add `https://kubernetes.default.svc` for the cluster url and `${TEST_NAMESPACE}` for the namespace
            - Add `https://kubernetes.default.svc` for the cluster url and `${STAGING_NAMESPACE}` for the namespace
        - Press Create

        !!!Note
            Initially, the only cluster that is available is the one in which Argo CD is - `https://kubernetes.default.svc`. By adding the two destinations we have allowed the project to be deployed to both the `${TEST_NAMESPACE}` and `${STAGING_NAMESPACE}` namespaces within the current cluster.

=== "Argo CD CLI"

    1. Log in to the Argo CD CLI

        ```shell
        argocd login {GRPC_INGRESS_HOST} --grpc-web [--sso]
        ```

        where:

        - `GRPC_INGRESS_HOST` is the host name of the grpc endpoint. On Red Hat OpenShift this is the same as the UI host
        - `--sso` is an optional flag used when sso authentication is enabled. If not using SSO then you will be prompted for
        the username and password

        The grpc url and credentials can be retrieved from the `igc credentials` command

    2. Create the project

        ```shell
        argocd proj create {PROJECT} --dest {CLUSTER_HOST},{TEST_NAMESPACE} --src {GIT_REPO}
        ```

        where:

        - `{PROJECT}` is the name you want to give to the project.
        - `{CLUSTER_HOST}` is the url for the cluster server to which the project applications can be deployed. Use `https://kubernetes.default.svc` to reference the same cluster where Argo CD has been deployed. `*` can also be used to allow deployments to any server.
        - `{TEST_NAMESPACE}` is the namespace in the cluster where the applications can be deployed. `*` can be used to indicate any namespace.
        - `{GIT_REPO}` is the url of the git repository where the gitops config will be located or `*` if you want to allow any.

        **Note:** The `--dest` and `--src` arguments can be provided multiple times if there are multiple destinations and/or sources that should be configured for the project

=== "Argo CD custom resource"

    1. Log in to the cluster from the command line

    2. Create a file named `project.yaml` with the following contents

        ```yaml
        apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
        kind: AppProject
        metadata:
        name: {PROJECT_NAME}
        spec:
        sourceRepos:
            - '*'
        destinations:
            - namespace: '*'
            server: https://kubernetes.default.svc
        ```

    where:

    - `{PROJECT NAME}` is the name of the project

    3. Apply the yaml to the cluster in the namespace where Argo CD has been deployed (e.g. `tools`)

        ```shell
        kubectl apply -f project.yaml -n tools
        ```

### Add an application in Argo CD for each application component

!!!Warning
    Before continuing to setup ArgoCD, please verify that the CI Pipeline run created the directory for the application on the gitops git repository and the directory container the helm related files including `requirements.yaml`

The last step in the process is to define the application(s) within Argo CD that should be managed. This consists of connecting the config within the Git repo to the cluster and namespace.

=== "Argo CD UI"

    1. Log into Argo CD user interface

    1. Press `New Application` and provide the following values:

        - `application name` - The name of the application. It is recommend to use the format of `{namespace}-{image name}`
        - `project` - The ArgoCD project with which the application should be included
        - `sync-policy` - The manner with which Argo CD will use to manage the deployed artifacts. `Automatic` is
        recommended
        - `repository url` - The Git url where the configuration is stored (restricted to git urls configured in the Argo Project)
        - `revision` - The Git branch where the configuration for this instance is stored
        - `path` - The path within the repository where the application config is located (should be the application name)
        - `destination cluster` - The cluster url for the deployment
        - `destination namespace` - The namespace where the application should be deployed (restricted to namespaces configured in the Argo Project)

    1. Repeat that step for each application and each environment

=== "Argo CD CLI"

    1. Log in to the Argo CD CLI

        ```shell
        argocd login {GRPC_INGRESS_HOST} --grpc-web [--sso]
        ```

        where:

        - `GRPC_INGRESS_HOST` is the host name of the grpc endpoint. On Red Hat OpenShift this is the same as the UI host
        - `--sso` is an optional flag used when sso authentication is enabled. If not using SSO then you will be prompted for
        the username and password

        The grpc url and credentials can be retrieved from the `igc credentials` command

    2. Create an application

        ```shell
        argocd app create {APP_NAME} \
        --project {PROJECT} \
        --repo {GIT_REPO} \
        --path {APP_FOLDER} \
        --dest-namespace {NAMESPACE} \
        --dest-server {SERVER_URL}
        ```

        where:

        - `{APP_NAME}` is the name you want to give the application
        - `{PROJECT}` is the name of the project created above or "default"
        - `{GIT_REPO}` is the url of the git repository where the gitops config is be located
        - `{APP_FOLDER}` is the path to the configuration for the application in the gitops repo
        - `{DEST_NAMESPACE}` is the target namespace in the cluster where the application will be deployed
        - `{SERVER_URL}` is the url of the cluster where the application will be deployed. Use `https://kubernetes.default.svc` to reference the same cluster where Argo CD has been deployed

=== "Argo CD custom resource"

    1. Log in to the cluster from the command line

    2. Create a file named `application.yaml` with the following contents

        ```yaml
        apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
        kind: Application
        metadata:
        name: {APPLICATION NAME}
        spec:
        destination:
            namespace: {TARGET NAMESPACE}
            server: {TARGET CLUSTER}
        project: {PROJECT NAME}
        source:
            path: {APPLICATION PATH}
            repoURL: {REPO URL}
            targetRevision: {REPO BRANCH}
            helm:
            valueFiles:
                - values.yaml
        syncPolicy:
            automated:
            prune: true
            selfHeal: true
        ```

        where:

        - `{APPLICATION NAME}` is the name of the application
        - `{PROJECT NAME}` is the name of the project (the one created in the previous step or `default`)
        - `{TARGET NAMESPACE}` is the namespace where the application should be deployed
        - `{TARGET CLUSTER}` is the server api url for the cluster where the application should be deployed. Use `https://kubernetes.default.svc` for the same cluster where Argo CD has been deployed
        - `{APPLICATION PATH}` is the path to the folder where the secret template was created
        - `{REPO URL}` is the url to the git repository
        - `{REPO BRANCH}` is the branch in the git repository that contains the application configuration

    3. Apply the yaml to the cluster in the namespace where Argo CD has been deployed (e.g. `tools`)

        ```shell
        kubectl apply -f application.yaml -n tools
        ```

### Managing secrets in Argo CD

The following provides the steps to handle protected information in a GitOps repository using the [Argo CD Key Protect plugin](https://github.com/ibm-garage-cloud/argocd-plugin-key-protect). The plugin takes yaml configuration as input, looks up the credentials in Key Protect, and generates a secret in the cluster from the results.

!!!Note
    If Argo CD was installed via the Toolkit then the plugin should already be installed and ready to use. If not, the instructions for installing the plugin can be found in the [plugin documentation](https://github.com/ibm-garage-cloud/argocd-plugin-key-protect).

#### Prepare the Key Protect instance

As the name suggests, the [Argo CD Key Protect plugin](https://github.com/ibm-garage-cloud/argocd-plugin-key-protect) leverages the capabilities of the Key Protect service to manage the protected information. The details for setting up and managing the Key Protect instance can be found in [Secret management with Key Protect](../reference/tools/key-protect.md). From
those instructions you can find the information required for the subsequent steps.

#### Create the secret configuration

The input to the plugin is a directory that contains one or more yaml "secret templates". In this case the "secret template" provides the
structure of the desired secret with placeholders for the values that will be pulled from the key management system.

1. Create a directory to contain the secret configuration. The [Argo CD Starter Kit](https://github.com/IBM/template-argocd-gitops) repository has a template in `templates/secrets-plugin` that can be copied as a starting point

2. Update the values in the yaml file for the secret that will be created

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: keymanagement.ibm/v1
    kind: SecretTemplate
    metadata:
      name: mysecret
      annotations:
        key-manager: key-protect
        key-protect/instanceId: instance-id
        key-protect/region: us-east
    spec:
      labels: {}
      annotations: {}
      values:
        - name: url
          value: https://ibm.com
        - name: username
          b64value: dGVhbS1jYXA=
        - name: password
          keyId: 36397b07-d98d-4c0b-bd7a-d6c290163684
    ```

    - The `metadata.annotations` value is optional.

        - `key-manager` - the only value supported currently is `key-protect`
        - `key-protect/instanceId` - the instance id of the key protect instance. If not provided then the `instance-id` value from the `key-protect-access` secret will be used.
        - `key-protect/region` - the region where the key protect instance has been provisioned. If not provided then the `region` value from the `key-protect-access` secret will be used.

    - The `metadata.name` value given will be used as the name for the Secret that will be generated.
    - The information in `spec.labels` and `spec.annotations` will be copied over as the `labels` and `annotations` in the Secret that is generated
    - The `spec.values` section contains the information that should be provided in the `data` section of the generated Secret. There are three possible ways the values can be provided:

        - `value` - the actual value can be provided directly as clear text. This would be appropriate for information that is not sensitive but is required in the secret
        - `b64value` - a base64 encoded value can be provided to the secret. This can be used for large values that might present formatting issues or for information that is not sensitive but that might be obfuscated a bit (like a username)
        - `keyId` - the id (not the name) of the Standard Key that has been stored in Key Protect. The value stored in Key Protect can be anything

3. Commit the changes to the GitOps repository

#### Add the secret application in Argo CD

Once the configuration has been added to the GitOps repository, Argo CD needs to be configured to deploy the secrets.

=== "Argo CD UI"

    1. Log into Argo CD user interface

    1. Press `New Application` and provide the following values:

        - `application name` - The name of the application. It is recommend to use the format of `{namespace}-{image name}`
        - `project` - The project with which the application should be included
        - `sync-policy` - The manner with which Argo CD will use to manage the deployed artifacts. `Automatic` is
        recommended
        - `repository url` - The Git url where the configuration is stored
        - `revision` - The branch where the configuration for this instance is stored
        - `path` - The path within the repository where the application config is located (should be the application name)
        - `destination cluster` - The cluster url for the deployment
        - `destination namespace` - The namespace where the application should be deployed
        - `Plugin` - In the last section of the UI select `Plugin` from the dropdown
            ![Argo CD plugin](./images/argocd-plugin.png)
        - `key-protect-secret` - Click in the name field and select `key-protect-secret` from the dropdown

        ![Argo CD key protect secret](./images/argocd-key-protect-secret.png)

    1. Repeat that step for each secret application and environment

=== "Argo CD CLI"

    1. Log in to the Argo CD CLI

        ```shell
        argocd login {GRPC_INGRESS_HOST} --grpc-web [--sso]
        ```

        where:

        - `GRPC_INGRESS_HOST` is the host name of the grpc endpoint. On Red Hat OpenShift this is the same as the UI host
        - `--sso` is an optional flag used when SSO authentication is enabled. If not using SSO then you will be prompted for
        the username and password

        The grpc url and credentials can be retrieved from the `igc credentials` command

    2. Create an application

        ```shell
        argocd app create {APP_NAME} \
        --project {PROJECT} \
        --repo {GIT_REPO} \
        --path {APP_FOLDER} \
        --dest-namespace {NAMESPACE} \
        --dest-server {SERVER_URL} \
        --config-management-plugin key-protect-secret
        ```

        where:

        - `{APP_NAME}` is the name you want to give the application
        - `{PROJECT}` is the name of the project created above or "default"
        - `{GIT_REPO}` is the url of the git repository where the gitops config is be located
        - `{APP_FOLDER}` is the path to the configuration for the application in the gitops repo
        - `{DEST_NAMESPACE}` is the target namespace in the cluster where the application will be deployed
        - `{SERVER_URL}` is the url of the cluster where the application will be deployed. Use `https://kubernetes.default.svc` to reference the same cluster where Argo CD has been deployed

=== "Argo CD custom resource"

    1. Log in to the cluster from the command line

    2. Create a file named `secret-application.yaml` with the following contents

        ```yaml
        apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
        kind: Application
        metadata:
        name: {APPLICATION NAME}
        spec:
        destination:
            namespace: {TARGET NAMESPACE}
            server: {TARGET CLUSTER}
        project: {PROJECT NAME}
        source:
            path: {APPLICATION PATH}
            repoURL: {REPO URL}
            targetRevision: {REPO BRANCH}
            plugin:
            name: key-protect-secret
        syncPolicy:
            automated:
            prune: true
            selfHeal: true
        ```

        where:

        - `{APPLICATION NAME}` is the name of the application
        - `{PROJECT NAME}` is the name of the project (the one created in the previous step or `default`)
        - `{TARGET NAMESPACE}` is the namespace where the application should be deployed
        - `{TARGET CLUSTER}` is the server api url for the cluster where the application should be deployed. Use `https://kubernetes.default.svc` for the same cluster where Argo CD has been deployed
        - `{APPLICATION PATH}` is the path to the folder where the secret template was created
        - `{REPO URL}` is the url to the git repository
        - `{REPO BRANCH}` is the branch in the git repository that contains the application configuration

    3. Apply the yaml to the cluster in the namespace where Argo CD has been deployed (e.g. `tools`)

        ```shell
        kubectl apply -f secret-application.yaml -n tools
        ```

### Configure another cluster as an Argo CD deployment target

Argo CD supports deploying applications into clusters other than the one into which it has been installed. To do that,
the target cluster must first be registered with Argo CD. After that, the cluster api server can be selected as a
deployment target within an application configuration. The following describes the steps required to add another cluster
as a deployment target:

1. Log in to the Argo CD CLI

    ```shell
    argocd login {GRPC_INGRESS_HOST} --grpc-web [--sso]
    ```

    where:

    - `GRPC_INGRESS_HOST` is the host name of the grpc endpoint. On Red Hat OpenShift this is the same as the UI host
    - `--sso` is an optional flag used when sso authentication is enabled. If not using SSO then you will be prompted for
    the username and password

    The grpc url and credentials can be retrieved from the `igc credentials` command

2. Log into the target cluster from the command line

3. Run the Argo CD command to list the available clusters

    ```shell
    argocd cluster add
    ```

    The currently selected cluster will be the one with the asterisk next to it. Copy the cluster id from the table

4. Add the cluster to Argo CD

    ```shell
    argocd cluster add {CLUSTER ID}
    ```

    where:

    - `{CLUSTER ID}` is the id of the target cluster from the previous step

5. Confirm the configuration by listing the known clusters

    ```shell
    argocd cluster list
    ```
