# Pipelines

The toolkit provides a number of pipelines for a number of programming languages.  Each pipeline is composed of several tasks.

A set of Tekton Pipelines and Pipeline tasks are imported to your cluster when the Cloud-Native Toolkit is installed.  The source for these pipelines and tasks can be found in [GitHub](https://github.com/IBM/ibm-garage-tekton-tasks){: target=_blank}
