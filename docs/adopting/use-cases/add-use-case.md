# Adding a new use case

You may want to extend the capabilities of the toolkit to provide additional functionality, such as adding support for a new programming language or use additional tooling.  When adding a new use case there are the areas you need to consider:

- create a new [starter kit](../../reference/starter-kit/starter-kit.md){: target=_blank} or update an existing one to ensure developers can efficiently use the use case?
- add or amend [pipelines or pipeline tasks](../../reference/tasks/pipelines.md){: target=_blank}?
- add [dashboard and console](../customize/config-dashboard/dashboard.md){: target=_blank} links (to make use case available to developers)
