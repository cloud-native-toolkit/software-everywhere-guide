# Adopting the Cloud-Native Toolkit

To get the most benefit from using the Toolkit, your development process should be based on an agile methodology designed for Cloud-Native development, which encompasses the entire software lifecycle, from initial concept, through development into production and operational running, such as the [IBM Garage Methodology](https://www.ibm.com/garage/method){: target=_blank}.

The following pages show some of the practices recommended as part of a modern, cloud-native development environment:

- [DevOps](devops.md){: target=_blank} - automated pipeline to build, test, integrate and deliver applications and services
- [Infrastructure as Code](infrastructure-as-code.md){: target=_blank} - manage infrastructure through version controlled configuration files backed by automation technology

You development tooling needs to support the development team and adopted methodology and processes.  The Cloud-Native Toolkit provides a good starting point for development tooling, but there are a number of decisions to make when creating a production setup of Toolkit
