Customize the Developer Dashboard and the OpenShift console

## Customizing the Dashboard

After the Dashboard has been installed into your development cluster, you can customize it to you team's needs. You can change the Title, Prefix, and Cloud Console links by adding the following environment variables to your deployment yaml.

Customize the Dashboard's title from its default of "IBM Cloud Garage"

- The necessary set of environment variables isn't defined by default. You need to edit the YAML for the `developer-dashboard` deployment in the `tools` namespace to insert this set of variables.
- Edit the YAML for the /tools/deployments/developer-dashboard resource. In the `spec.template.spec.containers` section, in the resources for the container named `developer-dashboard`, add a new `env` resource to this container that defines these environment variables:

    ```yaml
    env:
      - name: DASHBOARD_TITLE
        value: GSI Labs Sandbox
      - name: DASHBOARD_PREFIX
        value: IBM
      - name: CLOUD_TITLE
        value: Azure Console
      - name: CLOUD_URL
        value: https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/
      - name: LINKS_URL
        value: http://<url>/data/links.json
    ```

- Then fill in the values you want to use, such as the name of your team and company

    !!!Note
        The `CLOUD_TITLE`, `CLOUD_URL`, and `LINKS_URL` aren't needed when the platform is IBM Cloud

You can also tailor the list of content that is displayed in the Activation tab and the Starter Kits tab by creating your own version of the [`links.json`](https://github.com/ibm-garage-cloud/developer-dashboard/blob/master/public/data/links.json) JSON file and host that somewhere accessible to you cluster's network.

## Adding tools

You can add additional tools to the [Developer Dashboard](../../../reference/dashboard.md) and to the Tools menu on the OpenShift console. The tools in the cluster are added automatically, but the tools outside the cluster must be added manually. You can also add tools for the Cloud Paks that you install in the environment, for CodeReady Workspaces (if you've installed that in the environment), etc.

### Adding tools to the Dashboard

Use the [Cloud Native Toolkit CLI](../../../reference/cli.md) to add tools to the dashboard.

- Use this syntax to add a tool:

    ```shell
    igc tool-config --name <name of tool> --url <url of tool>
    ```

- These are tools that every Environment has but that are hosted outside of the cluster. To add these to the Dashboard, run these commands and provide the URLs:

    ```shell
    igc tool-config --name ir --url {url image registry}
    igc tool-config --name logdna --url {url to LogDNA instance}
    igc tool-config --name sysdig --url {url to Sysdig instance}
    igc tool-config --name github --url {url to git org}
    ```

- If your Environment includes the Cloud Paks with these tools, add them to your Dashboard:

    ```shell
    igc tool-config --name ta --url {url to the Transformation Advisor}
    igc tool-config --name mcm --url {url to IBM CP4MCM}
    igc tool-config --name integration --url {url to CP4I instance}
    ```

- If you've [installed CodeReady Workspaces](../../../resources/ibm-cloud/crw.md) in your Environment, add it to your Dashboard:

    ```shell
    igc tool-config --name codeready --url {url to the CRW instance}
    ```

This table lists the tools that can be displayed.

### Adding Tools to the OpenShift Console

If the environment includes an OpenShift cluster, the Environment adds a Tools menu to the OpenShift console. The tools in the cluster are automatically added, but you need to add the tools outside of the cluster to specify their URLs. You can also extend the Tools menu to provide fast links to common tools you the development team will require. These tools links are common across the cluster.

![OCP Console Tools](./images/ocp-console-tools.png)

- Edit the file called `tools.yaml` in the `terraform/scripts` folder. This file contains the Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) required to configure the menu items. Add custom links for `github`, `logdna`, and `sysdig`, and save the file.

- Run the `terraform/scripts/config-console-tools` script to apply the settings in `tools.yaml`. To do so: Make sure you are logged into your cluster from the command line and run the script, specifying your cluster's ingress subdomain. To find the ingress subdomain, go to the cluster overview page in the IBM Cloud console; it's something like `resource-group-NNN-XXX.region.containers.appdomain.cloud`.

    ```shell
    ./config-console-tools {cluster ingress subdomain}
    ```

- Optionally, you can extend the list of tools to include links to other tools. For example, here are two links to the Cloud Pak for Multicloud Management and the Cloud Pak for Integration.

    ```yaml
    ---
    apiVersion: console.openshift.io/v1
    kind: ConsoleLink
    metadata:
      name: toolkit-mcm
    spec:
      applicationMenu:

      text: Multi Cloud Manager

      location: ApplicationMenu
      text: Integration
    ```

## Obtaining links to external tools

To add external tools to the Dashboard and/or Tools menu, you need to know the links to those tools. Here's how to find those links.

### Image registry

To get the URL for the image registry:

- In the IBM Cloud console, navigate to Kubernetes > Registry or OpenShift > Registry
- On the Registry page, select the Images tab
- That URL for the Images tab (or any of the Registry tabs) is the one to add to the tools lists

### LogDNA dashboard

Get the URL for the LogDNA web UI in your environment (as explained in [IBM Log Analysis with LogDNA: Viewing logs](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/Log-Analysis-with-LogDNA?topic=LogDNA-view_logs))

- In the IBM Cloud dashboard, navigate to **Observability** > **Logging**
- Find the logging instance named after your environment's cluster, such as `showcase-dev-iks-logdna`. To help find it, you can filter by your resource group.
    ![LogDNA Logging Instance](./images/logdna-logging-instance.png)
- In the logging instance, the URL in the **View LogDNA** button is the one to add to the tools lists

### Sysdig dashboard

Get the URL for the Sysdig web UI for your environment (as explained in [Step 4: Launch the web UI](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/Monitoring-with-Sysdig?topic=Sysdig-getting-started#step4))

- In the IBM Cloud dashboard, navigate to **Observability** > **Monitoring**
- Find the monitoring instance named after your environment's cluster, such as `showcase-dev-iks-sysdig`

![Sysdig Monitoring Instance](./images/sysdig-monitoring-instance.png)

- In the monitoring instance, the URL in the **View Sysdig** button is the one to add to the tools lists
