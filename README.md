This user guide has been written to help Sellers, Builders and SRS get familiar with how to use to the assets and tools for the Software Everywhere project.

## Software Everywhere Programme
To help accelerate adoption of IBM Hybrid Cloud Software through our Ecosystem Labs team has launched the Software Everywhere initiative. The programme is designed to build a set of Site Reliability Engineering a.ka SRE automation and tools--to manage systems, solve problems and automate operations tasks.  The automation would help IBM Partners , IBMers and Clients to accelerate consumption of IBM Technology on key Hyperscaler partnerships, specifically AWS and Azure and IBM Cloud.  


The rendered User Guide can be viewed here - [https://ibm-software-everywhere.dev](https://ibm-software-everywhere.co)

*Note*: The Beta version of the User Guide can be found here - [https://beta.ibm-software-everywhere.dev](https://beta.ibm-software-everywhere.dev)

It is primarily used to document features that are currently in Beta prior to releasing those features (and the associated documentation). The content for the Beta version of the Developer Guide is sourced from the `beta` branch.

## Logos

We have painstakingly documented all of the logos and icons used for 3rd party tools and the process for
documenting their use within the User Guide and the broader set of assets. The [Logo Usage page](./docs/logos) documents
the approved logos and the requirements for their use.

## Contributing to Docs

To update and manage the User Guide, follow these steps in [Updating the User Guide](https://ibm-software-everywhere.dev/contribute/documentation/).

### Publish Content

This repository has been configured to build and publish the changes automatically via travis-ci. There are two builds currently configured:

- `main` branch is automatically published to the `gh-pages` branch in this repository which is visible here - https://cloudnativetoolkit.dev

**Note:** There is a time delay between when deploy process completes and when the
content is available on the published site.
